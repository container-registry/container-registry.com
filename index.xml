These distribution approaches are often OS specific. As a result, developers are forced to spend precious time on tailoring software delivery rather than innovation. Containerization is already simplifying software delivery for many of today&amp;rsquo;s mainstream products. Choosing the right &lt;a href="https://container-registry.com">container registry that meets ISVs requirements&lt;/a> is crucial to satisfy vendors and meet client expectations.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lifting Developersâ€™ Productivity with BuildKit CLI for kubectl</title><link>https://container-registry.com/posts/productivity-lift-buildkit-cli-for-kubectl/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://container-registry.com/posts/productivity-lift-buildkit-cli-for-kubectl/</guid><description>&lt;p>Developing and testing software on Kubernetes usually means building and moving container images from the developer workstation to a container registry, and ultimately, Kubernetes. When considering all the moving parts, the complexity and context switches break the development flow. Gone are the days where developers just hit a command and a few seconds later the newly built software is ready for testing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What if there was some magical tool that you could simply feed instructions like: &amp;ldquo;Build this Dockerfile &lt;em>here&lt;/em> and replace any existing image on &lt;em>that&lt;/em> Kubernetes cluster with the results!&amp;rdquo; ASAP. Spoiler Alert! That is exactly what BuildKit CLI for kubectl is there to do.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>3 Ways to overcome the Docker Hub pull rate limit</title><link>https://container-registry.com/posts/overcome-docker-hub-rate-limit/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://container-registry.com/posts/overcome-docker-hub-rate-limit/</guid><description>&lt;p>As someone who is working with Docker Container images, you came across the new Docker Hub pull rate limit or perhaps you are already here because you encountered the error message &lt;code>You have reached your pull rate limit&lt;/code> and are now looking for a solution on how to resolve it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Container Registry Terms of Service</title><link>https://container-registry.com/terms-of-service/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://container-registry.com/terms-of-service/</guid><description>Container Registry Terms of Service Effective as of: November 1, 2020

In September 2020 we switched our foundation from Portus to Harbor, to better serve those that mean the most to us, our customers.
Background Many solutions arise from their own and immediate needs. After we started a new container-centric consulting project and faced difficulties to find a decent alternative Docker Registry for the organization we were building, we merged into a microservice-based software.</description></item><item><title>Containerized Software Distribution</title><link>https://container-registry.com/containerized-software-distribution/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://container-registry.com/containerized-software-distribution/</guid><description>Distributing Commercial Software Through Container Images Distribute your software as a Docker Container.
