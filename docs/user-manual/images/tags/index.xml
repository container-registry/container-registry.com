This allows you to keep only the necessary artifacts and discard those that are no longer required or have been superseded by a newer version. Managing your repository in this way can help ensure that only the most needed artifacts are kept, freeing up valuable storage space.</description></item><item><title>Tag Immutability</title><link>https://container-registry.com/docs/user-manual/images/tags/tag-immutability/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://container-registry.com/docs/user-manual/images/tags/tag-immutability/</guid><description>Tag Immutability What Is Tag Immutability and Why You Need It Harbor, the technology behind Container Registry, cannot (yet) deal with the situation when more than one image has the same tag.
