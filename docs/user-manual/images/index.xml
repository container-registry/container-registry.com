In this view, you can also perform a few additional actions on the selected artifact.
Tags Overview Working with tags is described in detail in another tutorial since the features for doing this are distributed across the GUI. The current section explains general GUI features that are available in the single artifact view.</description></item><item><title>Working With Tags</title><link>https://container-registry.com/docs/user-manual/images/working-with-tags/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://container-registry.com/docs/user-manual/images/working-with-tags/</guid><description>Working With Tags Image tags have a function similar to those of the branch refs in Git: pointing to a state of the artifact at a specific time. Originally, the purpose of image tags was to differentiate between multiple versions of the same image. But more often than not different tags may refer to the same image.
The tags come in handy when you want to pull and run an image.</description></item></channel></rss>
