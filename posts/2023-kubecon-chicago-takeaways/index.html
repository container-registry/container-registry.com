What a
beautiful city. As someone who only experienced the United States through
movies, it felt a bit surreal at first, because around each corner or location I
felt like I had seen this exact scene in a movie.</p><p>From 5th to 9th November, people all over the world came together to talk and
discuss the future and direction of the Cloud Native ecosystem with various CNCF
projects and Kubernetes.</p><p>I was also present with colleagues and friends to represent the Harbor. During
that week, I participated in two presentations and spent some time at the Harbor
project booth speaking with Harbor users.</p><p>Due to those duties, I was unable to attend many sessions; yet, I was able to
attend quite a few keynote sessions and have many discussions with speakers and
maintainer and developers at the booths. This equipped me with a good feeling
about what does the Cloud Native crowd has on their agenda for 2024.</p><h2 id=kubecon-takeaways>KubeCon Takeaways</h2><p>I took away some exciting insights from discussions and presentations at KubeCon
2023, the current hypes and long-term developments in the cloud-native
landscape. I used the last two weeks after KubeCon to catch up in tranquility on
talks that I had reserved and not attended, as well as some talks that were
recommended to me.</p><p>KubeCon 2023 left me with several key takeaways:</p><ol><li>We are in an AI/ML Gold Rush phase.</li><li>Platform Engineering is the new DevOps</li><li>Developer Experience</li></ol><ul><li>Sustainability</li><li>Service Mesh and ePBF</li><li>Web Assembly/WASM</li></ul><h3 id=1-aiml-gold-rush-in-cloud-native>#1 AI/ML Gold Rush in Cloud Native</h3><p>There was a gold rush atmosphere like in the movies. There were gold diggers and
shovel sellers. I witnessed both groups in action, and with <a href="https://kccncna2023.sched.com/?searchstring=AI">almost a third of
the talks focusing on AI</a>, it
was crystal clear that AI took center stage at KubeCon.</p><p><img src=/posts/2023-kubecon-chicago-takeaways/kubecon-AI-ML-gold-rush_generated.jpg alt="AI/ML Gold Rush at 2023"></p><p>In that regard, Tim Hockin&rsquo;s keynote at KubeCon highlighted key thoughts for the
future of Kubernetes. The surge in cloud adoption, ubiquitous containerization,
and the impending wave of AI and ML workloads present both opportunities and
challenges. The need for Kubernetes to evolve into a platform of choice for AI
and ML, simplifying multicluster management, and addressing the growing
complexity within the project and its ecosystem were central concerns. The call
to manage a &ldquo;complexity budget&rdquo; and potentially streamline the landscape
reflects a recognition that simplicity and focus may be pivotal in Kubernetes'
success over its second decade. The quote, &ldquo;Kubernetes should stay unfinished,&rdquo;
serves as a rallying cry for continued evolution and adaptation for the next
decade.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/WqeShpaztZY style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="KubeCon 2023 NA – Keynote: A Vision for Vision - Kubernetes in Its Second Decade - Tim Hockin"></iframe></div><h3 id=2-platform-engineering>#2 Platform Engineering</h3><p>Platform Engineering is overshadowing DevOps. Even though DevOps was not
mentioned in the talk titles, the essence of the topic was present in the
discussions, which indicated that the space had evolved naturally.
This shift signals a natural evolution in the space, with both advantages and
challenges. Platform Engineering, geared towards simplifying deployment
complexities, not only eases the burden on developers and operations but also
opens avenues for enhanced security.</p><p>The very helpful <a href=https://tag-app-delivery.cncf.io/whitepapers/platform-eng-maturity-model/>Platform Engineering Maturity
Model</a>
offers a framework for organizations to think about and improve their internal
platforms. It emphasizes the collaborative nature of platform engineering in
providing optimal computing environments for internal users.</p><p><img src=/posts/2023-kubecon-chicago-takeaways/gru-meme-platform-engineering-devops-is-dead.png alt="Gru Meme about end of DevOps and Platform engineering"></p><h3 id=3-developer-experience>#3 <strong>Developer Experience</strong></h3><p><img src=/posts/2023-kubecon-chicago-takeaways/Balmer-developers-developers-developers.gif alt="Steve Ballmer talks about Developer Experience at KubeCon 2023"></p><p>Developer Experience, also often referred to as end user experience during
KubeCon, depending on the viewpoint, made a few appearances in the Keynote, but
was also present in many discussions.</p><p>In her lightning talk on choosing the right abstraction for developer
experience, Rosemary Wang emphasizes the challenge of finding the optimal
platform interface. While higher-level interfaces offer standardization, they
often lack customization. Wang introduces GitOps as a solution for platform
updates, providing a familiar interface for developers. She underscores the
importance of an escape hatch in the form of Version Control, asserting that,
despite various options available, developers will inevitably need to support
multiple abstractions for a well-rounded platform experience. I would like to
add that I think that the Open Container Initiative (OCI-Spec) may be a suitable
when not a better alternative to Version Control.</p><h3 id=sustainability>Sustainability</h3><p>Sustainability was a major focus in the keynotes and sessions. Why? Because data
centers consume around 2% of global power, and we&rsquo;re approaching the critical
1.5 °C global warming limit. This serves as a wake-up call for the IT industry.</p><p>To address this issue, we need accurate metrics to identify where we&rsquo;re emitting
the most carbon. This is a challenge in sustainability – understanding our
carbon footprint in software and infrastructure isn&rsquo;t easy.</p><p>The Green Software Foundation has developed the Software Carbon Intensity
specification, allowing us to calculate the carbon intensity of software.
Additionally, the Carbon Aware SDK helps identify sustainable energy sources,
supported by Kepler, an open-source project for energy monitoring using
Prometheus and eBPF.</p><h3 id=service-mesh-and-epbf>Service Mesh and ePBF</h3><p>You can&rsquo;t say Service Mesh without mentioning eBPF. It&rsquo;s hard to overlook the
significant role played by eBPF in Service Meshes, a low-level technology that
continues to mature. At KubeCon Cilium and its parent company, Isovalent, made a
notable presence with three booths, showcasing the different tools and for
different audiences. In recognition of its achievements, Cilium was promoted to
a graduate project, underscoring its importance.</p><p>For those fascinated by documentaries, I highly recommend watching the
beautiful, orchestrated and entertaining documentary about eBPF.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wb_vD3XZYOA style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="Documentary about eBPF: Unlocking the Kernel"></iframe></div><h3 id=web-assemblywasm>Web Assembly/WASM</h3><p>Web Assembly (Wasm) took the spotlight at the event. Alongside eBPF, it stood
out as one of the most discussed low-level technologies. Many engaging
discussions revolved around Wasm&rsquo;s application in developing extension plugins
for API gateways and service meshes.</p><h2 id=other-interesting-talks>Other interesting Talks</h2><p>Tim Hockin emphasized the challenges posed by the growing complexity of the
Kubernetes service API, which, after nearly 10 years, is limiting evolution and
causing implementation and testing difficulties. He proposed the Gateway API as
a potential replacement, highlighting its flexibility and composability,
allowing users to choose what they need from different implementations. Tim
acknowledged that these ideas are not commitments but encouraged feedback from
the community to explore and improve the concept further.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Oslwx3hj2Eg style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="KubeCon 2023 NA – Lightning Talk: Why Service Is the Worst API in Kubernetes, & What We’re Doing About It - Tim Hockin"></iframe></div><h2 id=harbor-at-kubecon-chicago>Harbor at KubeCon Chicago</h2><p>My Kickoff started with a lightning talk about <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aSsQY-cXM">Dynamically Proxying Helm
Charts as OCI Artifacts</a>.</strong> Even
though the lightning talk only lasts 5 minutes, it takes the same amount of
preparation to create the talk and get the message across well in that short
amount of time.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/y6aSsQY-cXM style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="KubeCon 2023 NA – Lightning Talk: Dynamically Proxy Helm Charts as OCI Artifacts - Vadim Bauer"></iframe></div><p>My second talk together with Wang Yang was about Harbor the new features coming
in 2.10, and the Harbor superpowers for different user groups like Ops, CISOs,
