From 5th to 9th November, people all over the world came together to talk and
discuss the future and direction of various CNCF projects, including Kubernetes.
I was also present with colleagues and friends to represent the Harbor. During
that week, I participated in two presentations and spent some time at the Harbor
project booth speaking with Harbor users.</p><p>Due to those duties, I was unable to attend many sessions; yet, I was able to
attend quite a few keynote sessions and have many discussions with speakers and
maintainer and developers at the booths. This equipped me with a good feeling
about what does the Cloud Native crowd has on their agenda for 2024.</p><h2 id=kubecon-takeaways>KubeCon Takeaways</h2><p>KubeCon 2023 left me with several key takeaways that shed light on the current
trends and future trajectories within the Cloud Native landscape. I took the
last two weeks to watch a few talks that I had bookmarked and that were
recommended to me.</p><h3 id=1-ai-gold-rush-during-kubecon>#1 AI Gold Rush during KubeCon</h3><p>It was like a gold rush, there were gold diggers and shovel sellers.
I witnessed both groups in action, and with <a href="https://kccncna2023.sched.com/?searchstring=AI">almost a third of the talks focusing on AI</a>,
it was crystal clear that AI took center stage at KubeCon.</p><p><img src=/posts/2023-kubecon-chicago-takeaways/kubecon-AI-ML-gold-rush_generated.jpg alt="AI/ML Gold Rush at 2023"></p><p>In that regard, Tim Hockin&rsquo;s keynote at KubeCon highlighted key thoughts for the
future of Kubernetes. The surge in cloud adoption, ubiquitous containerization,
and the impending wave of AI and ML workloads present both opportunities and
challenges. The need for Kubernetes to evolve into a platform of choice for
AI and ML, simplifying multicluster management, and addressing the growing
complexity within the project and its ecosystem were central concerns. The call
to manage a &ldquo;complexity budget&rdquo; and potentially streamline the landscape
reflects a recognition that simplicity and focus may be pivotal in Kubernetes&rsquo;
success over its second decade. The quote, &ldquo;Kubernetes should stay unfinished,&rdquo;
serves as a rallying cry for continued evolution and adaptation for the next decade.</p><p>Tim, the co-founder of K8s, not only excels as a presenter—evidenced by the
inclusion of two of his talks here—but also serves as the moral compass of the ecosystem.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/WqeShpaztZY style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="KubeCon 2023 NA – Keynote: A Vision for Vision - Kubernetes in Its Second Decade - Tim Hockin"></iframe></div><h3 id=2-platform-engineering>#2 Platform Engineering</h3><p>Platform Engineering is overshadowing DevOps. Even though DevOps was not
mentioned in the talk titles, the essence of the topic was present in the
discussions, which indicated that the space had evolved naturally.
This shift signals a natural evolution in the space, with both advantages and
challenges. Platform Engineering, geared towards simplifying deployment
complexities, not only eases the burden on developers and operations but also
opens avenues for enhanced security.</p><p>The very helpful <a href=https://tag-app-delivery.cncf.io/whitepapers/platform-eng-maturity-model/>Platform Engineering Maturity Model</a>
offers a framework for organizations to think about and improve their internal
platforms. It emphasizes the collaborative nature of platform engineering in
providing optimal computing environments for internal users.</p><p><img src=/posts/2023-kubecon-chicago-takeaways/gru-meme-platform-engineering-devops-is-dead.png alt=Untitled></p><h3 id=3-developer-experience>#3 <strong>Developer Experience</strong></h3><p>Developer Experience, also often referred to as end user experience, depending
on the viewpoint, made a few appearances in the Keynote, but was also present in many discussions.</p><p>In her lightning talk on choosing the right abstraction for developer experience, Rosemary Wang emphasizes the challenge of finding the optimal platform interface. While higher-level interfaces offer standardization, they often lack customization. Wang introduces GitOps as a solution for platform updates, providing a familiar interface for developers. She underscores the importance of an escape hatch in the form of Version Control, asserting that, despite various options available, developers will inevitably need to support multiple abstractions for a well-rounded platform experience. I would like to add that I think that the Open Container Initiative (OCI-Spec) may be a suitable when not a better alternative to Version Control.</p><h3 id=sustainability>Sustainability</h3><p>Sustainability was a major focus in the keynotes and sessions. Why? Because
data centers consume around 2% of global power, and we&rsquo;re approaching the
critical 1.5°C global warming limit. This serves as a wakeup call for the IT industry.</p><p>To address this issue, we need accurate metrics to identify where we&rsquo;re emitting
the most carbon. This is a challenge in sustainability – understanding our
carbon footprint in software and infrastructure isn&rsquo;t easy.</p><p>The Green Software Foundation has developed the Software Carbon Intensity
specification, allowing us to calculate the carbon intensity of software.
Additionally, the Carbon Aware SDK helps identify sustainable energy sources,
supported by Kepler, an open-source project for energy monitoring using Prometheus and eBPF.</p><h3 id=service-mesh-and-ebpf>Service Mesh and eBPF</h3><p>You can&rsquo;t say Service Mesh without mentioning eBPF. It&rsquo;s hard to overlook the
significant role played by eBPF in Service Meshes, a low-level technology that
continues to mature. At KubeCon Cilium and its parent company, Isovalent, made a
notable presence with three booths, showcasing the different tools and for
different audiences. In recognition of its achievements, Cilium was promoted to
a graduate project, underscoring its importance.</p><p>For those fascinated by documentaries, I highly recommend watching the beautiful,
orchestrated and entertaining documentary about eBPF.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wb_vD3XZYOA style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="DOCUMENTARY about eBPF: Unlocking the Kernel"></iframe></div><h3 id=web-assemblywasm>Web Assembly/WASM</h3><p>Web Assembly (Wasm) took the spotlight at the event. Alongside eBPF, it
stood out as one of the most discussed low-level technologies.
Many engaging discussions revolved around Wasm&rsquo;s application in developing
extension plugins for API gateways and service meshes.</p><h2 id=other-interesting-talks>Other interesting Talks</h2><p>Tim Hockin emphasized the challenges posed by the growing complexity of the Kubernetes service API, which, after nearly 10 years, is limiting evolution and causing implementation and testing difficulties. He proposed the Gateway API as a potential replacement, highlighting its flexibility and composability, allowing users to choose what they need from different implementations. Tim acknowledged that these ideas are not commitments but encouraged feedback from the community to explore and improve the concept further.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Oslwx3hj2Eg style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="KubeCon 2023 NA – Lightning Talk: Why Service Is the Worst API in Kubernetes, & What We’re Doing About It - Tim Hockin"></iframe></div><h2 id=harbor-at-kubecon-chicago>Harbor at KubeCon Chicago</h2><p>My Kickoff started with a lightning talk about <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aSsQY-cXM">Dynamically Proxying Helm Charts as OCI Artifacts</a>.</strong> Even though the lightning talk only lasts 5 minutes, it takes the same amount of preparation to create the talk and get the message across well in that short amount of time.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/y6aSsQY-cXM style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="KubeCon 2023 NA – Lightning Talk: Dynamically Proxy Helm Charts as OCI Artifacts - Vadim Bauer"></iframe></div><p>My second talk together with Wang Yang was about Harbor the new featues coming in 2.10, and the Harbor superpowers for different user groups like Ops, CISOs, and developers appriciate the most.</p><p>In details I was talking about</p><ol><li>How Harbor works well for small Teams and Enterprises at the same time.</li><li>How Harbor makes CISOs happy.<ul><li>Because all organizational images are in one place with Replication and Proxying</li><li>Becasue CISOs have an overview about all the image vulnerabilites in one place.</li><li>Because audit trails help to reconstruct who did what.</li></ul></li><li>Why Harbos is Ops people&rsquo;s darling<ol><li>Automation & IaC – RESTful API, Terraform, Pulumi</li><li>Operational control mechanisms – GC, Quota, Polices</li></ol></li></ol><p>The Second part of the talk was about the new features of Harbor, that will be introduced in version 2.10</p><ul><li>Robot Accounts with more customizable and fine grained permission sets.</li><li>Software Bill of Material (SBOM) for Harbor will provide a list with that enumerates the components, dependencies, and their versions within a container image, serving the purpose of enhancing transparency, traceability, and security in software supply chains.</li></ul><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/1QWy2zO0gBY style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="KubeCon 2023 NA – What’s New in Harbor, and How Can You Make Harbor Even Better? - Yan Wang & Vadim Bauer"></iframe></div><h3 id=notable-mentions-of-harbor>Notable Mentions of Harbor</h3><p>This 90-minute tutorial is an introduction to various CNCF graduated projects, simplifying the often challenging process of self-learning about cloud native projects.
